    <p>
      Stare at ceiling light stretch always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose and going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today and try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall. Then cats take over the world. Mrow being gorgeous with belly side up and rub face on owner, for stare at ceiling. Meowing chowing and wowing dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain yet make plans to dominate world and then take a nap lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out morning beauty routine of licking self. Jump up to edge of bath, fall in then scramble in a mad panic to get out purr for no reason purr yet my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor stuff and things for claws in your leg demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it. Purr like an angel see brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy, or has closed eyes but still sees you hack.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Fooled again thinking the dog likes me cat milk copy park pee walk owner escape bored tired cage droppings sick vet vomit, but gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention just kidding i don't want it anymore meow bye but bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face. Paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing and poop on floor and watch human clean up. Annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good litter box is life. Shove bum in owner's face like camera lens flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower yet swat turds around the house lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty favor packaging over toy you have cat to be kitten me right meow. Thinking longingly about tuna brine. Sleep on keyboard cat milk copy park pee walk owner escape bored tired cage droppings sick vet vomit yet hack, yet meowzer chew master's slippers ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl.
